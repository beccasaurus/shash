## Hashes for /bin/sh Shell

Although some unix shells like BASH support associative arrays, I wanted better "Hash tables" when writing shell scripts.

This provides hash-like functionality with a pleasant syntax.

It is compatible with /bin/sh and should be compatible with all of its descendants, eg. BASH and zsh
